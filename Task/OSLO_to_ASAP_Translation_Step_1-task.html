		<p>Either type the name of the file in the edit box or press the Browse

		</p>
 
		<p>The translator confirms the file’s existence by attempting to open it.
		  If it is successful, the name of the selected file appears in the edit box, and
		  the translator creates a default name for the ASAP file. (In this case, the
		  default name for the ASAP file is Anaprism.inr). If the translator cannot open
		  the OSLO file, it displays a message box.

		<p>The translator does not move to the next dialog unless a valid

		<p>After the OSLO file is selected, the translator reads the file for
		  compatibility with ASAP and displays a summary in the scrolling list box. The
		  list box has four columns of adjustable width for read truncated text. The
		  columns are:

		<p><b>Messages</b>
		</p>
 
		<p>Messages do not necessarily indicate that there is a problem. These
		  are intended to alert you to features and capabilities present in one program
		  that may be imprecisely translated into the other. Messages fall into the
		  following categories:
		</p>
 
		<p><b>Aperture specification is missing in the OSLO lens</b>. The OSLO
		  file did not contain an 
		  <b>AP</b> command specifying aperture information on one or more
		  surfaces.
		</p>
 
		<p><b>Valid but unsupported OSLO command was read by the translator</b>.
		  OSLO is a comprehensive lens design program with numerous features such as
		  drawing structure around elements, setting up element arrays, and so on, which
		  do not have direct analogs in ASAP and therefore cannot be translated. Certain
		  surface (eikonals, etc.) and phase diffractive types also fall into this
		  category.
		</p>
 
		<p><b>OSLO feature is only partially supported in ASAP</b>. OSLO can
		  describe certain surface types that can be modeled only partially in ASAP. To
		  accomplish the translation it is therefore sometimes necessary to truncate the
		  order of the polynomial, restrict the translation of a polynomial description
		  to specific terms, or call attention to a specific term that is not supported.
		</p>
 
		<p><b>OSLO file contains “special” surfaces or materials</b>. The
		  translator flags all types of aspherics, gradient index (GRIN) materials, and
		  diffractive surfaces.
		</p>
 
		<p>
		</p>
 
		<p>After creating the list, the translator writes out a summary
		  recommendation, which fall into five categories:
		</p>
 
		<p><b>Solves and/or pickups were found; delete before proceeding</b>.
		  Solves and pickups are used in lens design to establish relationships between
		  surfaces, locations and so on. Unfortunately OSLO only writes the relationship
		  into the LEN file, not the data being related; therefore, the LEN file does not
		  contain a complete prescription. 
		</p>
 
		<p><b>CAUTION:</b> Translating a LEN file with solves and/or pickups
		  almost certainly result in an erroneous ASAP model and so these should be
		  deleted prior to translation. (The OSLO commands, CSD and TSD may be used to
		  delete curvature and thickness solves and pickups.)
		</p>
 
		<p><b>Special surface types and/or materials were found; check ASAP
			 model</b>. The translator noted these while reading the OSLO file. Carefully
		  review the notes in the list box and the ASAP model for potential problems.
		</p>
 
		<p><b>Missing apertures on some surfaces; correct LEN file or set default
			 in next dialog</b>. Since precise aperture information is essential to ASAP,
		  this information must be supplied in order to perform the translation. While it
		  is probably best if you return to OSLO and properly set the aperture(s), you
		  can also set default apertures or ask to be prompted for apertures in the
		  second translation dialog.
		</p>
 
		<p><b>Unsupported commands were found and could affect translation
			 accuracy</b>. The translator noted these while reading the OSLO file. Carefully
		  review the notes in the list box and the ASAP model for potential problems.
		</p>
 
		<p><b>OSLO lens is ready for translation</b>. No warnings were found.
		</p>
 
		<p>
		</p>
 
		<p>At the completion of this dialog, click 
		  <b>NEXT</b> to continue, or 
		  <b>CANCEL</b> to terminate the translator.
