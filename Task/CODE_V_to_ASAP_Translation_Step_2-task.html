		<p>The translator constructs a default name for the ASAP file from the
		  CODE V SEQ filename that you enter in the Step 1 dialog. To change the name of
		  the ASAP file, enter the new name in the box under 
		  <b>Select ASAP File</b>. 
		</p>
 
		<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
		  <p>The translator overwrites an existing ASAP file if you accept the
			 default ASAP filename or type an existing filename into the box.
		  </p>
 
		  <p>If you are unsure whether the file currently exists or want to
			 protect an existing ASAP file, click BROWSE. The translator displays a 
			 <b>Save As</b> dialog. You can review the contents of the current
			 directory and enter a new filename. The translator does not overwrite an
			 existing file if you click the BROWSE button.
		  </p>
 
		</div>
 
		<p><b>Translation Options</b>
		</p>
 
		<p><b>Annotate ASAP INR file</b> Instructs the translator to write out
		  explanations and comments interspersed with the ASAP commands. This is useful
		  for novice users who wants to understand more about ASAP syntax, or for
		  documentation purposes. (Default: no check)
		</p>
 
		<p><b>Translate dummy surfaces</b> “Dummy surfaces” are defined by this
		  translator as surfaces that have the same refractive media on each side and are
		  coincident with the subsequent surface. Although these types of surfaces are
		  commonly used in lens design programs to restore coordinate systems in tilted
		  and decentered systems, they can mislead the physical raytrace algorithm in
		  ASAP and cause raytrace errors. (Default: no check)
		</p>
 
		<p><b>Create edges and bevels</b> Lens designers are accustomed to the
		  bevels and edges CODE V draws around the optical surfaces to denote physical
		  construction. Some users also employ the 
		  <b>CUM</b> and 
		  <b>THM</b> options to add rear surfaces and edges to mirrors to give
		  them a more realistic appearance. This option adds additional edge and bevel
		  objects to the ASAP file to duplicate these functionalities. (Default: check)
		</p>
 
		<p>The edge and bevel generation logic involves the following activities:
		  The translator first identifies adjacent surfaces that could potentially be
		  joined by an edge and possibly bevel(s). Next, the translator checks to see if
		  either surface is reflecting, if either surface is an SPS CPC Type 2 or Type 3
		  surface, or if one of the surfaces is a dummy surface. In any of these cases,
		  the translator cannot generate an edge or bevel. 
		</p>
 
		<p>The translator checks to see if the adjacent surfaces share a common
		  axis and have no aperture decentrations. If these conditions are met, the
		  translator then checks to see if the apertures have the same dimensions. In
		  this case only an edge is generated connecting the surfaces together. If the
		  aperture dimensions of one surface are both smaller than the aperture
		  dimensions of the other surface, a bevel is generated on the smaller aperture
		  and an edge is generated to connect the larger surface to the bevel. If the
		  aperture dimensions of one surface are not both smaller than those of the other
		  surface, a bevel is generated on each surface and an edge is generated to
		  connect the bevels. 
		</p>
 
		<p>If the surfaces do not share a common axis and/or have aperture
		  decentrations, the translator simply connects the apertures with an edge. No
		  bevels are generated.
		</p>
 
		<p>The two surfaces do not require the same aperture shape. The
		  translator generates an edge that connects a circular/elliptical aperture to a
		  rectangular aperture if necessary.
		</p>
 
		<p>A rear surface and edge are added to a mirror only if 
		  <b>THM</b> is nonzero. The curvature of the rear surface is given by 
		  <b>CUM</b>. If the mirror surface is an SPS CPC Type 2 or Type 3
		  surface, the rear surface and edge are not generated.
		</p>
 
		<p>Edges, bevels, and rear mirror surfaces are modeled as absorbing
		  objects (no 
		  <b>INTERFACE</b> command). You must add specular and scatter properties
		  as necessary.
		</p>
 
		<p><b>Make element color consistent</b> overrides the ASAP default object
		  color assignment by assigning the same color to all objects that comprise an
		  optical element. Otherwise, each object is sequentially assigned a color from
		  the ASAP palette of 27 colors. (Default: check)
		</p>
 
		<p>This option is independent of the “Create edges and bevels” option.

			 <p><b>Unassigned Apertures</b> Since ASAP must know the actual
				apertures of each object, these must be supplied even if they are missing from
				the CODE V SEQ file. The translator allows for two options:
			 </p>
 
			 <p><b>Prompt on surface-by-surface basis during translation</b> The
				translator displays a 
				<b>Setting Aperture</b> dialog box for each surface whose aperture
				information is missing. You can select the type of aperture (circular,
				elliptical, square, or rectangular), dimensions, and aperture decentration at
				that time. The translator does not accept a zero aperture dimension and issues
				a warning message if you enter one. (Default: select.)
			 </p>

			 <p><b>Assign default semidiameter of XXX</b> The translator assigns a
				default semidiameter of 
				<b>XXX</b> to each surface whose aperture information is missing.
			 </p>
 
			 <p>Once an aperture is entered on a given surface, it is used for all
				other zoom positions (if present). The translator does not prompt again for an
				unassigned aperture in another zoom position.
			 </p>
 
		  </li>
 
		  <li id="CODE_V_to_ASAP_Translation_Step_2__li_707011F0FB8D4F7C9F7BD83C09AD0D8C"><a name="CODE_V_to_ASAP_Translation_Step_2__li_707011F0FB8D4F7C9F7BD83C09AD0D8C"><!-- --></a>
			 <p><b>Coatings</b> Most lens design programs, CODE V among them, do
				not permit rays to be split into reflected and transmitted components at
				refractive surfaces. However ASAP does support this feature (called
				“raysplitting”). The translator offers both options when it constructs the ASAP
				geometry:
			 </p>
 
			 <p><b>Idealized (100%) transmission on all refractive surfaces</b>
				All refractive surfaces are set to unity transmission; there is no reflective
				component. (Default: 100% transmission)
			 </p>
 
			 <p><b>Transmission and reflection per Fresnel’s equations</b> The
				translator constructs the interface properties of each refractive surfaces so
				that ASAP can compute the transmission and reflection of each ray during the
				raytrace subject to the ray’s wavelength, angle of incidence, polarization and
				so on.
			 </p>
 
			 <p>By default the translator assigns a reflectivity of unity to each
				mirror (reflective) surface. You may change this by entering a new value into
				the edit box.
			 </p>
 
		  </li>
 
		</ul>
 
		<p>At the completion of the Step 2 dialog, click BACK to return to the
		  first dialog, NEXT to continue, or CANCEL to exit the translator.
