			 the Point Spread Function (PSF) is the optical equivalent of the impulse

			 no single command in the program for this calculation. It is performed by a
			 series of commands that set the window and pixel relationships for the Fourier
			 transform after the appropriate ray trace is done.

			 well-defined entrance and exit pupils.

			 Transform (FFT) is used to calculate the MTF, the sampling rate (number of
			 pixels) and window size must be made commensurate. This means that the area
			 over which the PSF is calculated must map into the transfer function space with
			 the correct spatial frequency cutoff. While the word diffraction is used in the
			 following derivation, the arguments are equally valid in the geometrical
			 regime. These cutoffs are determined according to the following rationale.

		  <li id="li_4CA6B20D101340158209E9DC69B99E50">The basic rule for MTF
			 calculations is that the window area should enclose a major fraction of the
			 total energy contained in the PSF. By concentrating on diffraction PSFs, it is
			 known that 84 percent of the total energy is contained in the central core of
			 an ideal Airy pattern. Referring to the equation, Solving for w, a window the
			 size of the core requires about 35 pixels for an F/2 system at 0.5 microns.
			 Ideally, you should use a somewhat higher sampling, particularly if the system
			 suffers from a small amount of aberration. In the presence of aberration,
			 energy is taken from the central core and distributed to the ring structure. 
		  </li> 
		  <li id="li_0BDACB3E0D8B4195B1571C5A1C0C19DB">Another recommendation is
			 to use an odd number of pixels for these calculations to ensure the presence of
			 a pixel at the center of the PSF/MTF. Using this recommendation avoids a
			 non-aesthetic shift in the patterns when there is no central pixel. 
		  </li> 
		  <li id="li_8DC0C9EB07BB476E9A0005088208833C">Once system parameters are
			 configured properly and the ray trace is completed, you must calculate the
			 system PSF with 
			 <cmdname>SPREAD NORMAL</cmdname> or FIELD ENERGY. The resulting
			 distribution file is entered into 
			 <cmdname>DISPLAY</cmdname> where the actual FFT is computed with the
			 DISPLAY command FFT.
