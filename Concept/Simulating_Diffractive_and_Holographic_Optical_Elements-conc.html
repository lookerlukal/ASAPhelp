  <div><p>Diffractive Optical Elements (DOEs) are a general class of optical
	 elements that include diffraction gratings, holographic optical elements (HOEs)
	 and binary optics. These elements diffract light by producing periodic changes
	 in the phase or amplitude of an incident wave. This topic addresses DOEs that
	 change the phase of incident optical fields. 
  </p>
 
	 <p>Two common approaches to calculating the diffraction pattern from DOEs
		are:
	 </p>
 
	 <br/><a name="conc__ul_E2A23FFD5CA74878BF600DA24DA20E05"><!-- --></a><ul id="conc__ul_E2A23FFD5CA74878BF600DA24DA20E05"> 
		<li id="conc__li_2923CF09619044AA93E5B4A5DD9F3FE9"><a name="conc__li_2923CF09619044AA93E5B4A5DD9F3FE9"><!-- --></a>Calculating the directions
		  of propagation of the various reflected and transmitted orders of a beam after
		  interacting with the DOE as well as the fractional power contained in each
		  order using vector diffraction theory. This complicated calculation involves
		  not only the DOE structural data, but also the physical and electromagnetic
		  properties of the DOE. ASAP does not perform this type of approach.
		</li>
 
		<li id="conc__li_A1D020D410D942A7B645E772DBFA2794"><a name="conc__li_A1D020D410D942A7B645E772DBFA2794"><!-- --></a>Calculating the idealized
		  directions of propagation of the various reflected and transmitted orders of a
		  beam after interacting with a diffractive element using scalar diffraction
		  theory. The diffraction orders are selected by adjusting the direction cosines
		  of the exiting beams according to the grating equation. The diffraction
		  efficiencies cannot be calculated with this method since this is a scalar
		  technique. Most optical design and analysis software, including ASAP, use this
		  technique since it is very adaptable to ray tracing. 
		</li>
 
	 </ul>
 
	 <p>ASAP models DOEs by simulating the phase surface of the DOE as a series
		of grating lines. Replicating the grating line spacing mathematically simulates
		the grating lines. The replication is then associated with the base entity of
		an object. After intersecting the base object, ASAP computes the local grating
		spacing and applies the grating equation to compute the direction of
		propagation. Moreover, since ASAP can split rays, it can also propagate several
		diffracted orders simultaneously after the intersection.
