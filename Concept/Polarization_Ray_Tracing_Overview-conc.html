		<p>To perform a polarization ray trace, you must configure the system
		  geometry and sources for the ray trace. The primary method of configuring the
		  system geometry for a polarization ray trace is to issue a 
		  <b>FRESNEL BOTH</b> command. 
		</p>

		<p><b>FRESNEL</b> has many options including the ability to
		  calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients independently as a
		  function of either an 
		  <b>s</b> or 
		  <b>p</b> state or an incoherent average of the two. 
		  <b>FRESNEL BOTH</b> is required for a complete polarization
		  ray trace. The 
		  <b>FRESNEL</b> command can be issued at your discretion and
		  only affects the ray trace.
		</p>

		<p>To configure the source, you must add a physical property to the
		  source with the 
		  <b>POLARIZ</b> command, which sets up the initial
		  polarization state of the rays. The command parameters are very similar to the
		  Jones Calculus format.
		</p>
 
		<p>In the ASAP unpolarized mode of operation, the optical field 
		  <b>U</b> is a scalar quantity that is solely a function of position.
		  The field is therefore written as:
		</p>
 
		<p><i>U = U(q,r)</i>
		</p>
 
		<p>where 
		  <b>q, r</b> are arbitrary coordinates. When polarization analysis is
		  requested, the optical field becomes a complex vector quantity of the form:
		</p>
 
		<p><i>U = (aq + a'r) U(q,r)</i>
		</p>
 
		<p>where 
		  <b>q, r</b> are orthogonal unit vectors and 
		  <i>a,a' 
		  </i>are complex amplitudes in the two orthogonal directions. It follows
		  that the direction of propagation 
		  <b>k</b> is given by:
		</p>
 
		<p><i>k = q x r</i>
		</p>
 
		<p>The variables, 
		  <b>a</b> and 
		  <b>a'</b> may be interpreted as Jones vector coefficients if the model
		  is set up in a specific orientation. 
		</p>
 
		<p>Recognizing that the ASAP polarization formalism is similar in
		  structure to that of Jones calculus, it is not surprising that ASAP shares its
		  limitations. Therefore, when polarization ray tracing is requested, ASAP can
		  only propagate coherent beams that are completely polarized. Unpolarized beams
		  must be synthesized by superimposing beams of (user-specified) random
		  polarization states.

		<p>Ray tracing analysis techniques traditionally have assumed unpolarized
		  light and ignored the polarization sensitivity of optical interfaces and
		  coatings. In more recent years however, the demands for accurate assessment of
		  the polarization state of light passing through an optical system have grown in
		  support of the design of increasingly sensitive instrumentation. Consequently,
		  most comprehensive optical design/analysis software have this analysis
		  capability.
		</p>
 
		<p>Two optical techniques have been used over the years for the
		  characterization of polarized light: Jones Calculus and Mueller Calculus. ASAP
		  uses neither of them, although the Jones calculus is close to what ASAP does:

			 <p>Jones Calculus
			 </p>
 
			 <p>The Jones calculus was designed specifically for purely polarized
				light and is mathematically compact: polarizing elements are described by a
				complex 2x2 matrix (the Jones matrix) and the polarization state vector is a
				2-vector (the Jones vector). While much simpler to manipulate, the penalty is
				of course the amount of complex arithmetic.

			 <p>Mueller Calculus
			 </p>
 
			 <p>The Mueller calculus is more general than Jones calculus, since it
				can describe both polarized and unpolarized light and everything in between.
				The penalty for this generality is the verbosity of the mathematics: polarizing
				elements are described by a 4x4 matrix (the Mueller matrix) and the
				polarization state vector is a 4-vector (the Stokes vector). Tracing the
				polarization state through a system involves a series of 4x4 matrix
				multiplications at each surface intersection for each ray that is traced.
