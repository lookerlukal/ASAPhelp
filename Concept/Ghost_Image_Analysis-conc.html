	<div><p>Ghost images are produced by inter-reflections of light from optical element surfaces
		that have nonzero reflection and transmission coefficients. Some of the incident light is
		transmitted at a surface of the element while some is reflected at the same surface. The
		reflected light propagates back to another element surface, is reflected there, and
		eventually propagates to the image plane or detector. The culmination of these reflections
		results in a ghost image.</p>

		<p>Calculating the overall ghost contribution to an image is important in determining system
			performance. Furthermore, evaluating the contributions of individual components of the
			ghost images will help identify the major ghost image contributors for corrective
			action. ASAP has a specific command for such an evaluation.</p>

		<p>In ghost image and scatter analysis, rays can split from many different objects and
			propagate to the image or detector plane following a particular path. By determining
			these paths, you can then determine, among other things, major contributors of ghosted
			or scattered energy. This is accomplished with the <b>PATHS</b> command. The
				<b>PATHS</b> command prints out a table of ray paths according to the
			current, previous, and initial objects as a function of either the average or peak
			irradiances or the total flux or the object flux. In fact, specific paths can be
			selected with the <b>SELECT</b> command for individual analysis.</p>

		<p>The Example of Ghost Image Analysis demonstrates the calculation of ghost image
			irradiance levels produced by the uncoated surfaces of an F/6.3 triplet system. In a
			majority of ghost image analyses, a <b>SPLIT 2</b> is sufficient to simulate
			the ghost reflections. For simplicity the example was restricted to a single wavelength
			and a single field point (on axis). The <b>FRESNEL AVE</b> command was used
			to automatically account for angularly dependent transmission and reflection losses at
			the interfaces.</p>

		<p>The input signal beam becomes a PSF at the image plane. All of the fundamental Gaussian
			beams making up the signal beam are coherent with respect to each other. The ghosted
			beams, for the most part, are incoherent with respect to each other and the input signal
			beam. When ASAP splits them. it does not alter their coherence, that is, their beam
			shape. You can account for the difference in image and ghost beam coherency by using the
			coherence length option on <b>SPREAD NORMAL</b> to treat the ghosted beams
			incoherently with respect to the signal beam. This method is recommended for calculating
			ghost contributions. Perform a similar calculation to demonstrate the <b>PATHS</b> command and the <b>SELECT</b> command by isolating
			everything but the input signal path and changing all of these beam shapes to be
			incoherent with respect to each other and the input signal beam.</p>
