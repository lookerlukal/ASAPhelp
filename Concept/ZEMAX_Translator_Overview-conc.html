	<div><p>ASAP OPTICAL+ and ASAP ADVANCED include a ZEMAX-to-ASAP translator for opening ZEMAX files in ASAP. </p>

		<p>When you open a ZEMAX file (File&gt; Open), the Open Files dialog box displays. Choose
				<b>zemax files (*.zmx, *.zmax)</b> from the drop-down list next to
				<b>Files of type</b>. Locate the ZEMAX file and click Open. The
			startup dialog is displayed, from which you designate names of input/output files and
			set Preferences. </p>

		<div class="section"><span style="color: #2b6eb5"><h5>Overview </h5></span>
			
			<p>In ASAP, each surface is placed in a global coordinate system. To find the
				coordinate, ASAP performs these steps for each surface. </p>

			<br/><ol>
				<li>From the ZEMAX data, ASAP calculates the location and orientation of each
					surface in a single global coordinate system. </li>

				<li>ASAP determines the transformation matrix for each surface required to transform
					the surface from its local coordinate system to the global coordinate system. </li>

				<li>ASAP decomposes the transformation matrix into the angles and positioning
					variables required by ASAP. </li>

			</ol>

		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
				<p>ZEMAX has a special “tilted” surface to tilt a surface with respect to the
					previous surface, but does not change the coordinate system of the previous
					surface. This type of surface is taken into account when computing the ZEMAX
					global coordinate system and the transformation matrices to transform each
					surface from its local coordinate system to the global coordinate system. </p>

			<p>The following table highlights the major differences between ZEMAX and ASAP, and is
				for information purposes only. </p>

			<br/><table border="0"><thead align="left"/><tbody><tr style="background-color:#e8f0fb;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 11px"><td><span/></td><td><span><b>ZEMAX</b></span></td><td><span><b>ASAP</b></span></td></tr><tr style="background-color:#e8f0fb;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 11px"><td><span>Defining Geometry</span></td><td><span>
						<p>Defines surfaces with respect to the previous surface. </p>

						<p>Uses an artificial surface (call a “coordbrk” surface) to define changes
							in the decentration and orientation of surfaces following the “coordbrk”
							surface. Coordinate transformations are always defined with respect to
							the coordinate system of the previous surface. </p>

					</span></td><td><span>
						<p>Defines surfaces in a Global Coordinate System. </p>

			<p>Defining Optical Media </p>

			<br/><table border="0"><thead align="left"/><tbody><tr style="background-color:#e8f0fb;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 11px"><td><span>Standard optical glasses</span></td><td><span>Computes the index of refraction for each wavelength form glass
						dispersion formulas given in a glass catalog. If a user of ZEMAX changes a
						wavelength or wavelengths, ZEMAX recalculates the new indices of refraction
						from the dispersion formulas.</span></td><td><span>For standard glass, ASAP uses a table of indices of refraction. The
						table can either be explicitly defined computed from the ASAP glass
						catalogs. ASAP glass catalogs may not be identical to ZEMAX glass catalogs.
						If a user changes to a wavelength not defined in the wavelength-index table,
						ASAP linearly interpolates the index of refraction for the new
					wavelength.</span></td></tr><tr style="background-color:#e8f0fb;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 11px"><td><span>Birefringent (crystals) mediums</span></td><td><span>Uses a special glass catalog “birefringent” to get the dispersion
						formulas for the extraordinary rays. The glass name for the extraordinary
						ray has an “-e” appended to the glass name for the ordinary ray. The axis of
						the crystal is stored in the surface data matrix. ZEMAX uses a
						multi-configuration system containing two configurations to define the ray
						tracing properties for a crystal. One configuration, called mode one, traces
						the ordinary ray. The other configuration, call mode two, traces the
						extraordinary ray.</span></td><td><span>For birefringent (crystal) mediums, ASAP defines a <b>CRYSTAL</b> medium, including the indices of refraction for the
						extraordinary rays, the crystal axis, and a “pointer” to the medium that
						defines the indices of refraction for the ordinary ray. ASAP can define and
						trace both the ordinary and extraordinary components of an incident ray at
						the same time. ASAP correctly distributes the flux of the incident ray
						between the ordinary and extraordinary refracted ray.</span></td></tr><tr style="background-color:#e8f0fb;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 11px"><td><span>Beam splitters – type 1</span></td><td><span>Type 1 is partially reflecting and partially transmitting. Two cases
						for this type of beam splitter exist. First, a ray traveling in one
						direction (for example, left to right) transmits through the surface,
						intersects a mirror, and returns to the beam splitter surface traveling in
						the opposite direction (for example, right to left) and reflects off the
						surface. Because ZEMAX is a sequential ray-tracing program, the beam
						splitter surface must be entered twice in the lens design data, once for the
						transmitting surface and once for the reflecting surface. These two surfaces
						are located in different positions in the lens design sequence and,
						therefore, ZEMAX has no ambiguity as to when to transmit or when to reflect
						the incident ray. This type of beam splitter is defined in a single
						configuration of the lens design. </span></td><td><span>The user defines a “coating” that gives the reflectance and
						transmittance properties for each wavelength. Ray splitting is used to split
						the ray into its reflected and transmitted components. Type 1 beam splitters
						are typically 50% reflecting and 50% transmitting.</span></td></tr><tr style="background-color:#e8f0fb;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 11px"><td><span>Beam splitters – type 2</span></td><td><span>This type of beam splitter is used to transmit or reflect rays
						according to their wavelength. In ZEMAX, this requires a multi-configuration
						system with two configurations. One configuration is defined for the
						transmitting path. The other configuration defines the reflection path.</span></td><td><span>The user defines a “coating” that gives the reflectance and
						transmittance properties for each wavelength. The difference is that for the
						wavelengths that transmit the ray, the coating has a zero (or a very small)
						reflectance component and a one- (or very nearly one) transmission
						component. For the wavelengths that reflect the ray, the coating has a one-
						(or very nearly one) reflectance component and a zero (or very nearly zero)
						transmittance component.</span></td></tr><tr style="background-color:#e8f0fb;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 11px"><td><span>Ray Tracing Technique</span></td><td><span>A sequential ray tracing program. Does have a non-sequential block</span></td><td><span>A non-sequential ray tracing program.</span></td></tr><tr style="background-color:#e8f0fb;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 11px"><td><span>Duplicate Surfaces</span></td><td><span>Causes no problems. In certain situations, they are required.</span></td><td><span>
						<p>Causes problems with non-sequential ray tracing. Therefore, there should
							be no duplicate surfaces in ASAP. </p>

						<p>ASAP partial reflecting-transmitting coating eliminates the need for
							duplicate surfaces. </p>

					</span></td></tr><tr style="background-color:#e8f0fb;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 11px"><td><span>Artificial Surfaces</span></td><td><span>
						<p>Uses “coordbrk” surfaces to define decentered and rotated surfaces. </p>

						<p>Uses “standard” surfaces with the same glass type as the previous
							surface. A lens designer using ZEMAX may use an artificial surface in
							ZEMAX for several reasons. For example, in a Cassegrain telescope the
							user may place an artificial surface after the secondary mirror at the
							location of the primary mirror. This surface can serve two purposes: to
							calculate the size of the central hole needed in the primary mirror, and
							to calculate the back focal length of the system. </p>

					</span></td><td><span>Avoid using artificial surfaces in ASAP, except where necessary to
						define mechanical constraints.</span></td></tr><tr style="background-color:#e8f0fb;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 11px"><td><span>Zoom Lenses</span></td><td><span>Uses a multi-configuration design to define zoom lenses. Each zoom
						position is a separate configuration of the design.</span></td><td><span>Define a separate ASAP inr file for each zoom position. To distinguish
						one zoom position from another, the translator appends the letters _zp#
						(where # is replaced by the ZEMAX zoom position #) to the end of the ASAP
						base file name.</span></td></tr></tbody></table>
