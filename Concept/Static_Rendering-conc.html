  <div><p>You can create a rendering of the system geometry by setting the
	 appropriate WINDOW and PIXEL values (and optionally, LIGHT values), and then
	 entering the RENDER command. The RENDER command traces a grid of rays whose
	 density is determined by the PIXEL command through the viewing window.
  </p>
 
	 <p>If a ray intersects an object, ASAP computes the angle from the surface
		normal and sets the value of the corresponding pixel of the distribution data
		file to the proper color and intensity. In this way, the rendering is built up
		from essentially a raster sampling of rays. The distribution data file is like
		the film for the rendering photograph. 
	 </p>
 
	 <p>View the resulting rendering using any of the methods for viewing
		distribution data files. The Display window is most commonly used.
	 </p>
 
	 <p>The advantage of this approach is that every object is correctly
		rendered regardless of its complexity, including objects based upon
		user-defined surfaces/functions. Since the rays follow physically realizable
		trajectories, complicated bounds, holes, and obscurations are also properly
		rendered regardless of their placement or orientation.
	 </p>
 
	 <p>To render the ray trace, you must first issue the 
		<b>SAVE</b> command so that ASAP saves the intersection
		coordinates of each ray with each object in a file. The 
		<b>RAYS</b> option on the 
		<b>RENDER</b> command adds the ray trace to the rendering by
		creating small diameter tubes around each ray. In a sense, each ray is actually
		a tube object. 
	 </p>
 
	 <p>View the complete rendering with the Display window. (The 
		<b>RENDER</b> command produces a black background if there
		are no objects with which to intersect the rays. Since large amounts of black
		have a tendency to smudge when printed, you may want to change the background
		color from black to white before importing it. Use the isotropic option in the
		Display window to view the rendering at the proper scale.)
