  <div><p>Performing a scatter analysis is a complex task. In addition to
	 basic scatter theory, there are many ASAP parameters to consider. Each analysis
	 should be evaluated on an individual basis to determine which ASAP tools to use
	 to simulate the problem. 
  </p>
 
	 <p>A fundamental concept to consider first is the type of scatter you want
		to simulate:

		  called near-specular scatter, is the scattered radiation propagating very close
		  to the specular beam. It is typically generated from the specular beam
		  interacting with scatter surfaces such as lenses and mirrors.

		<li id="Scatter_Analysis__li_D1A42044435047BEB952FBF8BB4C6961"><a name="Scatter_Analysis__li_D1A42044435047BEB952FBF8BB4C6961"><!-- --></a>Out-of-field scatter,
		  conversely, is scattered radiation that does not propagate close to the
		  specular beam. In fact, it may be incident radiation from beyond the FOV of the
		  optical device that scatters off baffles or mounts and eventually reaches the
		  detector or image plane.

		<p>ASAP uses different scattering commands to simulate in-field and
		  out-of-field scatter as well as different analysis techniques to analyze the
		  different scatter contributions. 
		</p>
 
		<p>In either in-field or out-of-field scatter, ASAP generates incoherent
		  scattered rays at an object in a similar sense to generating specular split
		  rays. The 
		  <b>OBJECT 
		  </b>command modifier, 
		  <b>SCATTER</b>, informs ASAP that the object is a
		  scattering object. SCATTER is an independent modifier of the object, but it can
		  also use information from another optical properties database, called 
		  <b>MODELS</b>, which contains scatter models. 
		</p>
 
		<p>The 
		  <b>OBJECT</b> modifier distinction is closely associated
		  with the type of scatter simulation you are performing. For example, 
		  <b>SCATTER BSDF</b> or 
		  <b>SCATTER RMS</b> are 
		  <b>OBJECT</b> modifiers for in-field scatter calculations. 
		  <b>SCATTER RANDOM</b> or 
		  <b>SCATTER MODEL i</b> are 
		  <b>OBJECT</b> modifiers for out-of-field scatter
		  calculations. For more information, see Scatter Analysis: Common Approaches. 
		</p>

	 <div class="section" id="Scatter_Analysis__section_9DE2836559A346D8BF28EEE128899EA0"><a name="Scatter_Analysis__section_9DE2836559A346D8BF28EEE128899EA0"><!-- --></a><span style="color: #2b6eb5"><h5>Specular Split Rays</h5></span> 
		 
		<p>When generating specular split rays, the 
		  <b>SPLIT</b> command controls the number of splits. An
		  analogous command, 
		  <b>LEVEL</b>, controls the number of levels of scattered
		  rays. For in-field scatter calculations, 
		  <b>LEVEL</b> sets to 1. At each interface, ASAP generates a
		  scattered ray that travels along with the specular ray. Higher levels of
		  scatter, for in-field scatter from optically polished surfaces, are
		  unnecessary: the power scattered by a scattered ray is significantly less than
		  the original signal ray power. 
		</p>
 
	 </div>
 
	 <div class="section" id="Scatter_Analysis__section_75AAEB8AB6C34C03AD7E9E49CBA8DC09"><a name="Scatter_Analysis__section_75AAEB8AB6C34C03AD7E9E49CBA8DC09"><!-- --></a><span style="color: #2b6eb5"><h5>Out-of-Field Scatter</h5></span> 
		 
		<p>The 
		  <b>LEVEL</b> command is typically set to a larger number
		  for out-of-field scatter calculations. In these situations scattered rays may
		  contain high enough power levels to be of significance at the next level of
		  scatter. Also, the 
		  <b>SCATTER RANDOM</b> or 
		  <b>SCATTER MODEL</b> object modifiers allow multiple rays
		  to be generated for a single input ray, independent of the 
		  <b>LEVEL</b> command setting, which is necessary to
		  simulate radiation propagating in directions other than the specular direction,
		  that is, out of field. 
		</p>
 
		<p>Out-of-field scatter calculations require generating many rays. The
		  rays are generated with a Monte-Carlo technique whereby the ray direction is
		  randomly chosen to propagate into a hemisphere, and the ray flux is adjusted
		  according to the BSDF of the object. 
		</p>
 
		<p>Although all the scattered rays can propagate into the hemisphere, but
		  this is an inefficient simulation technique. For example, it requires
		  generating a large number of rays for each incident ray to place enough rays at
		  the detector to obtain a reasonable statistical accuracy for the simulation. 
		</p>

		  Accuracy</h5></span> 
		 
		<p>To improve the scatter calculation efficiency and statistical
		  accuracy, ASAP uses a modified Monte-Carlo technique to force scattered rays to
		  propagate toward important areas. It is the 
		  <b>TOWARDS</b> command - a 
		  <b>SCATTER RANDOM</b> and 
		  <b>SCATTER MODEL</b> modifier.

		<p>The results of in-field and out-of-field ray trace calculations are
		  analyzed with different techniques. The scattered rays generated for in-field
		  calculations are incoherent beams with a specific set of propagation rules. 
		  <b>SPREAD NORMAL</b> analyzes their combined effect.
		  Scattered rays generated for out-of-field calculations are simulated as rays
		  and not beams. 
		  <b>SPOTS</b> analyzes their combined effect. 
		  <b>SELECT 
		  </b>and 
		  <b>PATHS</b> commands isolate beams of interest for your
		  analysis. Whereas in-field calculations are almost automatic, out-of-field
		  calculations require more user interaction. You must define the appropriate
		  scatter models, create important areas for an efficient scatter ray trace, and
		  then analyze the results with a 
		  <b>SPOTS</b> command.
