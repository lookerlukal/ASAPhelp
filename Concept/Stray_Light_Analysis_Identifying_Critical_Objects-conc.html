	<span style="color: #2b6eb5"><h5>Stray Light Analysis - Identifying Critical Objects</h5></span>
	
	
	<div><p>Identifying critical objects is perhaps the most important part of a stray light
		analysis. The critical objects are those objects seen by the detector, either directly or
		directly imaged onto the detector. </p>

		<p>These objects contribute all the unwanted optical power that is scattered to the
			detector. Some critical objects may be easy to spot from mechanical engineering
			diagrams. However, many may not easily be deduced from the drawings. For example,
			imaging and re-imaging by the optical components of a system often make identifying
			critical objects a difficult task. However, with the integrated system and source
			modeling, nonsequential ray tracing algorithm, and graphics in ASAP, the task of
			identifying critical objects may be simplified considerably. </p>

		<p>With ASAP, you can construct sources at any location within the optical system.
			Therefore, you can create a source at the detector of the system and trace rays backward
			from the detector to identify the critical objects. At this point in the analysis, you
			are not generating any scattered rays and your sources should not have a large number of
			rays. You might even consider only tracing a fan of rays to reduce the ray trace density
			on graphical plots. You are simply using ASAP to obtain an intuitive feel for the
			system's characteristics. After you have an intuitive feel for the system, you can trace
			large numbers of rays from all areas of the detector to identify critical objects that
			subtend small solid angles or are out of plane. </p>

		<p>You can next use the <b>EMITTING DISK/RECT</b> command to assess critical
			objects. The <b>EMITTING</b> command will distribute rays randomly across
			the detector and propagate them into random directions. After the rays are traced
			backward through the system you can use the <b>STATS POSITION</b> command to
			identify critical objects. You can use the <b>STATS POSITION </b> command
			also to assist in calculating the power scattered to the detector from the critical
			objects. Use the <b>PATHS</b> and <b>SELECT</b> commands to
			evaluate and select ray paths to identify or clarify unexpected or poorly understood
			paths. </p>

ASAP identifies illuminated objects by tracing rays forward through the optical system in the conventional manner. The illuminated objects, as well as the amount of power incident upon them, also may be printed with the STATS POSITION command.</li>

ASAP may be used directly to calculate the amount of radiation scattered to the detector when the critical and illuminated objects are known, as well as the paths connecting them to the detector.</li>
