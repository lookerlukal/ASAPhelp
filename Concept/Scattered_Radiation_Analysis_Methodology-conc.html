  <div><p>The goal in a classical stray light analysis usually is to
	 determine the amount of unwanted scattered radiation propagating to a detector
	 in order to assess its effect on system performance. 
  </p>
 
	 <p>The unwanted scattered radiation may come from signal beams that you are
		trying to detect or from noise sources. It may even be thermally generated. The
		optical elements may scatter radiation to the detector from the signal or noise
		sources. The noise sources may interact with optical components and mechanical
		structures causing scattered radiation. In any situation a basic three-step
		process is followed to determine the amount of scattered radiation getting to a
		detector.
