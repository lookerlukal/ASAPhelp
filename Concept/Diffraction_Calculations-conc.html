		<p>The ASAP beam superposition algorithm models an arbitrary optical
		  field with fundamental beams. The fundamental beams are each represented by an
		  apodization function, such as a Gaussian, and a set of real rays describing the
		  apodization function, which may be traced through the opto-mechanical system.
		  This set of rays characterizes the near-field and far-field properties of the
		  beam. It is possible to use the ray trace information from the individual beams
		  to recreate the energy distribution at any position in space. How these
		  fundamental beams interact with each other determines the coherence of the
		  source. 
		</p>
 
		<p>Traditionally, diffraction analyses are done using two very different
		  methods, each with limitations. However, the diffraction analysis option in
		  ASAP does not use either of these techniques and therefore does not suffer from
		  these limitations. 
		</p>
 
		<p>You can derive the pupil function, if enough rays are traced through a
		  system and the optical path differences (OPD) between the rays are calculated.
		  By using Fourier transform techniques on this function, you can get the point
		  spread function (PSF), which in turn may be Fourier-transformed to obtain the
		  system transfer function. This method is probably the most common technique
		  implemented in current optical design software. Consider the following:
