			<p>In out-of-field situations, it is crucial that important areas are properly
				configured within your system model. For example, important areas are often pupil
				sizes and placed at pupil locations to force scattered radiation in the general
				direction of the detector. At this point in the stray light analysis, the critical
				and illuminated objects should have the appropriate scattering models assigned to
				them. </p>

			<p>Initially, trace only a small number of rays from the scatter source to verify that
				the system geometry and associated scatter commands were entered correctly. When the
				preliminary calculations are complete, you may trace a large number (and scatter a
				large) number of rays to obtain an accurate calculation of the scattered radiation
				propagating to the detector plane. The <b>PATHS</b> command is
				especially useful for assessing scattered ray paths and their associated scattered
				power. </p>

			<p>ASAP may be used to perform a first-order stray light analysis of power scattered to
				the detector. This technique may be alone, or as a first-order check on a power
				transfer analysis described previously. This is accomplished by first relating the
				information on the <b>STATS</b> command to the basic power transfer
				equation. The basic power transfer equation is </p>

			<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
				<p>The geometrical configuration factor (GCF) is composed entirely of geometrical
					quantities. If you now propagate radiation from an <b>EMITTING</b>
					area (with a normalized total flux of 1 flux unit) backward from the detector
					the power transfer equation becomes, since the BSDF of a Lambertian surface or
					emitter is 1/p. </p>

			</p>

			<p>If this quantity is multiplied by the ratio of the area of the collector to the
				source, you obtain the GCF from the source to the collector as a function of power
				of, or on, the source. Therefore by tracing rays from the detector, using the
					<b>STATS POSITION </b>command, and the appropriate source and
				collector areas, the GCF from the source to the collector is determined. If you now
				trace rays into the system with an appropriate normalization, the <b>STATS
					POSITION </b> command may be used to calculate the power on each source
				object. Again apply the BSDF form of the power transfer equation to calculate the
				power scattered to the detector. </p>

			<p>If thermal emission is important in your analysis, then multiply each GCF from
				collector to the source by the Stephan-Boltzman constant, the temperature to the
				fourth power, the object emissivity, and the collector area to obtain the thermally
				emitted power scattered to the detector. </p>

			<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
				<p>This is a first-order analysis of the power scattered to the detector, which
					should get to within a factor of three to four of an actual ASAP analysis. If it
					does not, re-evaluate your analysis. </p>

				<p>In general, predicting the actual power scattered to the detector to within a
					factor of two to three is good. </p>
