			<p><b>Afocal systems: </b>
			</p>

			<p><b>AFC</b> is supported but accommodation ACM is not. </p>

			<p><b>AFO</b> is not supported. The perfect lens is modeled as a dummy plane. </p>

			<p><b>AFI</b> is supported. The perfect lens is modeled as an <b>IDEAL</b> ASAP lens.
			</p>

			<p><b>Alternate surface intersection</b>: Alternate surface intersection flag <b>IC</b>
				is not supported. </p>

			<p><b>Apertures</b>: Only simple circular, elliptical, and rectangular apertures are
				supported. Aperture decentrations are supported but aperture rotations (<b>ARO</b>)
				are not. If there are multiple apertures on a surface, only the first aperture is
				used. Labeled apertures are supported. </p>

			<p><b>Array elements</b>: Array elements are not supported. </p>

			<p><b>Coatings</b>: Coatings are not supported. </p>

			<p><b>Depth of focus</b>: Only the nominal focal plane location is translated. </p>

			<p><b>Fictitious glasses</b>: CODE V uses a proprietary dispersion model based upon six
				“real” glasses to compute the refractive indices of fictitious glasses at the
				specified wavelengths. A similar model was developed for this translator; however,
				there are small refractive index differences. BRO recommends that you replace
				fictitious glasses with “real” glasses prior to attempting a translation. </p>

			<p><b>GDP</b>: This partial dispersion option is not supported. </p>

			<p><b>Gradient index (GRIN) media</b>: Only the reference wavelength gradient function
				is in the ASAP model. The following gradients are not supported: </p>

			<p> Gradient Lens Corporation </p>

			<p>Luneburg and Maxwell </p>

			<p>Selfoc </p>

			<p>User-defined gradients </p>

			<p><b>Holographic surfaces: </b>
			</p>

			<p>Volume HOEs are not supported; they are translated as surface HOEs. </p>

			<p>Phase terms involving absolute values are not supported. These include <b>HCT AXY,
					HCT XAY, HCT XYA</b> and <b>HCT AR</b>. </p>

			<p>User-defined phase functions are not supported. </p>

			<p>CODE V can model a two-point HOE with aspheric phase terms; however ASAP has no
				equivalent diffractive entity. The translator breaks the single CODE V HOE surface
				into two (or three) ASAP objects a small distance apart. The first ASAP object is
				the two- point HOE; the second is the aspheric phase HOE. (If the CODE V surface is
				reflective, a dummy reflecting object is also created to restore the propagation
				direction.) </p>

			<p>You must set the <b>SEARCH</b> command so that the rays follow the desired
				trajectory. </p>

			<p><b>Interferometric Deformations and Intensity Apodizations</b> are not supported. </p>

			<p><b>Lens modules</b>: Only the focal length and principal reduction ratio are
				supported. </p>

			<p><b>Non-sequential surfaces:</b> While ASAP raytrace is fundamentally non-sequential,
				the differences between CODE V and ASAP make an automated translation unfeasible.
				Consequently, predefined non-sequential modules such as corner cubes (<b>CCR</b>)
				and roof prisms (<b>ROO</b>) are also not supported. </p>

			<p><b>Non-spherical surfaces: </b>
			</p>

			<p>Thermal gradient surfaces and user-defined surfaces are not supported. </p>

			<p><b>Pickups</b>: Pickups are not supported. This is not an issue with CODE V-generated
				SEQ files, since CODE V writes both the pickup instructions and the resulting
				parameter values into the SEQ file. However, user-generated SEQ files must contain
				the resulting parameter values for the translation to be successful. </p>

			<p><b>Polarization</b>: Polarized sources, linear polarizing elements and retarders are
				not supported. </p>

			<p><b>Private catalog: </b>
			</p>

			<p>Dispersion formulae are not supported. </p>

			<p>Melt fit option <b>MLT</b> is not supported. </p>

			<p>Transmission data <b>TRN</b> , specific gravity data <b>SPG</b>, and price data <b>PRC</b> are not supported. </p>

			<p><b>Pupil Apodization</b>: Pupil apodization is not supported. </p>

			<p><b>Refract/reflect mode</b>: <b>RMD</b> is not supported. </p>

			<p><b>Solves</b>: Solves are not supported. This is not an issue with CODE V-generated
				SEQ files, since CODE V writes both the solve instructions and the resulting
				parameter values into the SEQ file. However user-generated SEQ files must contain
				the resulting parameter values for the translation to be successful. </p>

			<p><b>Special surfaces:</b>
			</p>

			<p>Bounding box dimensions are not used by the translator. </p>

			<p><b>CN1</b> surfaces (Fresnel surface on a right circular cone with parallel back
				cuts) are not supported. </p>

			<p><b>CN2</b> surfaces (Fresnel surface on a right circular cone with non-parallel back
				cuts) are not supported. </p>

			<p><b>FRS</b> surfaces (Fresnel surface on planar substrate) are not supported. </p>

			<p><b>SEG</b> surfaces (segmented conic surface) are not supported. </p>

			<p><b>XYP</b> polynomial surfaces are not supported. </p>

			<p><b>ZRN</b> surfaces (standard Zernike surface) are not supported. </p>

			<p><b>Specification data</b>: Image space specifications (for example, <b>FNO</b>, <b>XIM</b>) are not supported. Operating modes such as <b>WID</b>, <b>CRA</b>, <b>TEL</b>, <b>XZF</b> do not affect the system geometry and so they are not
				translated. You must construct the desired raytrace characteristics. </p>

			<p><b>Surface grouping</b>: Surface grouping is not supported. </p>

			<p><b>Thermal expansion, atmospheric and pressure data:</b> Environmental conditions are
				not supported. </p>

			<p><b>Tolerance data</b>: Tolerance data is ignored by the translator. </p>

			<p><b>Wavelengths and refractive indices</b>: The translator writes out all the
				wavelength and refractive index data that is specified in the CODE V SEQ file. Make
				sure the number of wavelengths/refractive indices does not exceed the ASAP capacity.
