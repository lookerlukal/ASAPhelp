CURVE/EDGE
PATCHES makes current data actually define a rational Bezier surface mesh.

VUFACETS shortcut for facetting and viewing current objects.
SURFACE/FUNCTION
USERSAG creates a surface with a user-defined radial or toric profile.
EXPLICIT converts current function to explicit form (e.g. for DEFORM).
DUMP currently selected rays to a binary file (DIS format).
EMITTING DATA creates rays from data in given binary distribution file.
Linear Transformations
SCALE FROM given length units to the current system UNITS.
MODEL

If ray was split at a certain object.
Those paths not listed in last PATH command.
USERAPOD ANGLES has a new short form with no angle clipping entries.
VUFACETS and PLOT FACETS can minimize facetting on some objects when possible.
APODIZE POS/DIR can set apodization axis (default is average axis of rays).
SURFACE/FUNCTION
REVOLUTION can now do a better fit on up to 1000 coordinate pairs.
ZERNIKE default aperture is unit circle but can be reset to RECT or ELLIP.
FITTED FIXTERM option no longer needed in most circumstances.
DISPLAY
FOLD can now take an optional pixel number.
CONTOUR LOW/HIGH and VECTOR options can now be used together.
GRAPH can now AUTOscale the specified data subset.
DECOMPOSE
POS can optionally use a nearby wavefront to avoid phase ambiguity.
Overall beam direction can be set by sign in front of POS or DIR entry.
SELECT ray flags has been increased in number by a factor of 4.
MODEL
BSDFDATA internal buffer increased from 2000 to 10000 BSDF values.
Number of PLOTted incident/specular directions increased from 5 to 7.
SUM is now fully recursive, i.e. it can reference other SUM models.
USERBSDF now also passes wavelength to user-defined function.
SYSTEM now stores and recalls any required user $FCN definitions.
SHAPE of a beam can be the fundamental mode of a circular step-index FIBRe.
FIELD can now COUPLE or MULTIPLY the current distribution with a previous one.
Option to temporarily override window directions and size on any plot.
MATRIX can recall the orientation (or inverse) of a given surface entity.
EMITTING
OBJECT/ENTITY can direct rays parallel to local surface normal.
DISK/RECT can now be of zero size (point source).
SEED QUASI with zero seed value implements a special non-random case.
