			<p>The ASAP 6.5 release contains 54 improvements and advances the efficiency, accuracy, and usability of ASAP, while addressing specific requests from our customers.</p>

			<p/>

			<p><b>Ray Tracing</b></p>

			<p>Improves ray trace efficiency and lets you model coatings without knowledge of the coating prescription. </p>

			<p><b>Exterior Lighting Test Module â€“ ASAP/ELTM</b></p>

			<p>The new Windows-based ASAP Exterior Lighting Test Module (ELTM) facilitates the process of testing automotive exterior lighting. Analyze and test illumination patterns of reflector and sources for determining compliance with government requirements. An intuitive wizard-like interface walks you through the testing steps with a few easy-to-use dialog boxes.</p>

			<p>With ASAP/ELTM, over 30 SAE requirements and an entire testing environment are ready to use, allowing you to focus on developing the optical system itself, such as a headlamp reflector. Test criteria are based on the SAE Ground Vehicle Lighting Standards Manual, SAE HS-34, from the Society for Automotive Engineering.</p>

			<p><b>Visualization: Data Viewer</b></p>

			<p>The Data Viewer includes several enhancements for creating plots of ray spots. You now have control over contours, palettes, pointers, and labeling. New control options mean many more ways to view and analyze your data.</p>

			<p><b>Performance Control</b></p>

			<p>You can now select computation CPU consumption setting. Via the ASAP Preferences, select how much of the CPU will be allocated to ASAP to compute intensive tasks (kernel tasks). This is useful if you do a lot of short computing-intensive tasks. You can set ASAP to consume the CPU, so your task (ray trace) would complete more quickly.</p>

			<p><b>New Runtime</b></p>

			<p>Due to the new Fortran (V6.0) and the new VC++ (6.0) programs, some performance gains in handling large PLR and DIS files is now possible.</p>

			<p/>

			<p><b>Builder</b></p>

			<p>The ASAPâ„¢ Geometry and Source Builder now provides quick access to several key system design settings, including: </p>

			<p><b>Support for POINTS-based Geometry</b>: add any two-dimensional or three-dimensional shape to your system quickly and easily using the Points Editor. </p>

			<p><b>Preview Faceting Control</b>: control the level of intra-faceting and inter-faceting used when previewing your Builder geometry. Increase the level of faceting for a more precise rendering of your system; decrease the level of faceting for a faster rendering. </p>

			<p><b>Append or Replace System Geometry</b>: choose to add your Builder geometry to your system, or replace the system geometry entirely. You can work on your system in a single Builder and replace the geometry as you need to, or work on each unique portion of your geometry in separate Builders and append each part of the system as you need it. </p>

			<p><b>Localized Units Settings</b>: temporarily override the ASAP system units settings for your Builder geometry when you need to. </p>

			<p><b>Automatic Entities</b>: create objects from entities automatically - without applying the OBJECT command. Define any single entity object implicitly while retaining the use of all entity and object modifiers. </p>

			<p><b>New Context-Specific Coloring</b>: find your geometry definitions faster with color-coded Builder rows. Each type of geometry is optionally associated with a unique color. </p>

			<p/>

			<p><b>BRO Bulb Library</b></p>

			<p>The BRO Bulb Library now includes over 30 industry bulbs, from which you can import a bulb model directly into your ASAP system geometry.</p>
