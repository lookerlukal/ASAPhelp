		<p>Enhancement
		</p>
 
		<p>The behavior of 'SPOTS ... ATTRIBUTE n' has been changed to reduce the
		  likelihood of user error affecting the interpretation of distribution files.
		  The affected distribution file is updated for all allowed values of the
		  ATTRIBUTE option n. The overhead associated with this redundancy is typically
		  negligible on modern systems and is justified by the reduced probability of
		  misinterpretation. The new behavior reinforces the importance of making a $COPY
		  of the BRO009.DAT file, if the results will be required later, as subsequent
		  commands may overwrite the BRO009.DAT file. See for example the topic,
		  “Distribution Data Files Overview” in the online help.
		</p>
 
		<p>
		</p>
 
		<p>06PRD00000116
		</p>
 
		<p>Enhancement
		</p>
 
		<p>Three options have been added to the SELECT command. SELECT ADD … adds
		  rays to the currently selected set. SELECT REMOVE … removes rays from the
		  currently selected set. SELECT NONE unselects all rays and may occasionally be
		  a convenient logical complement to SELECT ALL. For more information, please see
		  USER DOCUMENTATION addenda below.
		</p>
 
		<p>
		</p>
 
		<p>06PRD00000396
		</p>
 
		<p>Fix
		</p>
 
		<p>The EDGE… POINTS… OBJECT construct produced an object which would not
		  reliably raytrace with ACCURACY HIGH (the default). The most typical symptom
		  was rays passing through the object. Sometimes rays would intersect properly
		  from one side but not from the other. This defect was introduced in ASAP 8.0.5
		  with improved BPM accuracy. The defect affected all raytracing with ACCURACY
		  HIGH and not just BPM.
		</p>

		</p>
 
		<p>06PRD00000425 &amp; 06PRD00000450
		</p>
 
		<p>Fix
		</p>
 
		<p>Total internal reflection (TIR) for all media was not completely
		  reliable, as the result of a change made in ASAP 2005 V2R2 related to
		  birefringent materials. Symptoms included premature ray-cessations and low-flux
		  warnings. Correct TIR behavior has been restored for isotropic materials.
		  Accurate TIR for birefringent materials, which has never been supported by
		  ASAP, remains unsupported.
		</p>
 
		<p>
		</p>
 
		<p>06PRD00000449
		</p>
 
		<p>Enhancement
		</p>
 
		<p>A large number of informational messages (which are neither errors nor
		  warnings) could clutter the output console, particularly when reading IGES
		  files or working with the Light Source Library. Duplicate informational
		  messages are now suppressed. Additionally, informational messages can be
		  suppressed entirely with $MSGS OFF.

		<p>Errata &amp; Addenda – ASAP On Line Help Topic SPOTS
		</p>
 
		<p>The following remark:
		</p>
 
		<p>Normally, ASAP produces a distribution file of accumulated ray fluxes
		  at each pixel location. The ATTRIBUTE option (other than SPOTS ATTRIBUTE 0)
		  instructs ASAP not to create a distribution file and to print only a symbol
		  where each ray strikes, as shown by the following:
		</p>
 
		<p>is superseded by:

		<p>ASAP produces a distribution file of accumulated ray fluxes at each
		  pixel location. The ATTRIBUTE option instructs ASAP to plot a symbol where each
		  ray strikes, as shown by the following:
		</p>
 
		<p>
		</p>
 
		<p>The following remark:
		</p>
 
		<p>The spot diagram data also is placed into the BRO030.DAT (or
		  filename.vcr) file, but only if the ATTRIBUTE i is less than one.

		<p>Addenda – ASAP On Line Help Topic SELECT
		</p>
 
		<p>The following expanded syntax is now incorporated into this topic:
		</p>
 
		<pre class="codeblock">
SELECT [ ALL ]
         ADD          [ entry entry' [ AND entry entry' ...
                                                   OR
         REMOVE  [ entry entry' [ AND entry entry' ...
                                                   OR
         ONLY        [ entry entry' [ AND entry entry' ...
                                                   OR

         EXCEPT    [ entry entry' [ AND entry entry' ...                  
         NONE</pre>
 
		<p> To support the expanded syntax, the following remarks were
		  incorporated into this topic:
		</p>
 
		<p>ADD and REMOVE add or remove rays matching a subsequent Boolean
		  condition to or from, respectively, the set of currently selected rays.
		</p>
 
		<p>NONE takes no Boolean conditional and makes the set of currently
		  selected rays equivalent to the empty set. It is included for convenience.
		</p>
 
		<p>Boolean conditions are specified by entering pairs of entries
		  separated by a logical operator (AND/OR) according to the following table...
