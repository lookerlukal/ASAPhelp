		<div class="section" id="Version_6_6__section_CB34CE84989F4C6EB548104E590BB2D0"><a name="Version_6_6__section_CB34CE84989F4C6EB548104E590BB2D0"><!-- --></a><span style="color: #2b6eb5"><h5>New Commands</h5></span>
			
			<p>MODELS</p>

			<p>PHYSICAL This is a new scatter model that can be used for random rough surfaces when you know physical surface parameters (RMS roughness and auto-correlation length). PHYSICAL attempts to model rough surfaces all the way to grazing incidence.</p>

			<p>VIEW Similar to OBLIQUE, but VIEW gives you a true perspective view for future plots made in two-dimensional plot windows.</p>

			<p>SURFACE</p>

			<p>CORNER A new surface entity that you can use for efficient modeling of corner-cube retro reflectors.</p>

			<p>LENS</p>

			<p>PERFECT A new lens entity that you can use as an alternative to IDEAL under some circumstances.  PERFECT will give more realistic results when the object plane is at infinity.</p>

			<p>FTSIZE Lets you set the size of subsequent Fourier transforms to values smaller than the maximum allowed (the default) by your version of ASAP. This applies to the commands: DECOMPOSE DIRECTION, OPDMAP PSF, and FFT.</p>

			<p>CURVE</p>

			<p>SPLINE, GENERAL 3D and SPLINE, EXPLICIT 2D  SPLINE is new curve entity for defining two-dimensional or three-dimensional cubic-spline curves by specifying points and slopes.</p>

			<p>TRACE The PLOT option with TRACE now supports plotting only those rays whose starting position is within a specified distance from the zero plane.  This gives you a method of suppressing child rays in the graphics.</p>

			<p>FRESNEL…TIR The TIR option with FRESNEL supports 100% reflection TIR conditions, even though you have specified an explicit, non-unity reflection coefficient.  At all other incident angles, your specified R and T values apply, and ASAP performs no angle-dependent flux calculations.</p>

			<p>PLOT POLARIZATION An optional weighting factor now gives you additional control over the size of the polarization ellipses.</p>

			<p>CAD, CAD IGES, and CAD DXF now export most surface-based objects.  Trimming performed using the BOUNDS command is not yet implemented.</p>

			<p>PLOT FACETS The HIDE option on PLOT FACETS now 	has a different default viewing distance that closely simulates the behavior of a typical 35-mm camera lens.</p>

			<p>RENDER The RENDER command can now take reflected scatter into account if you have applied scattering properties to any of the surfaces.  You can use this to simulate the illuminated appearance of your objects.  Rays can also be added to a rendering if SAVE was turned on prior to the last ray trace.</p>

			<p>RAY segments can be rendered as smooth shaded cylinders (anti-aliasing).</p>

			<p>ARRAY…BOUNDS The logic used for BOUNDS with arrays will be consistent with other ASAP entities. This is treated as an option to maintain backward compatibility.</p>

			<p>TRACE The new ACCUM option computes the same information as TRACE STATS, but does not print the information immediately after the ray trace.  Instead, selected flux and position statistics can be displayed after first applying a CONSIDER command.  (See STATS TRACE below).</p>

			<p>STATS TRACE This new version of the STATS command supports selective display of trace statistics made previously using TRACE ACCUM or TRACE STATS.</p>

			<p/>

			<p>MODELS</p>

			<p>BSDFDATA The BSDFDATA model is used to interpolate observed scatter data. Now you can specify a choice of coordinate systems and interpolation methods.  BSDFDATA is one of five scatter models that support anisotropic scattering surfaces.  This means you can model surfaces with characteristics similar to diamond-turned or brushed finishes.</p>

			<p>HARVEY, USERBSDF, BSDFDATA, NONLINEAR, and SUM Now support anisotropic scattering.</p>

			<p>RAY PLOT Often used to create and trace single rays, this command now plots parabasal rays as well. </p>

			<p/>

			<p>CURVE</p>

			<p>BEZIER/POINTS/PATCH The maximum allowed degree for all three of these curve-edge based entities was increased from 10 to 20.  For the PATCH command, the smaller of the two degrees can now be cubic or higher. All these features are included primarily to facilitate more accurate IGES translations of complex surfaces, when required. Most users will access these new capabilities via the IGES translator (See “IGES Import" under "Other Kernel Changes" below).</p>

			<p>PATCH Smaller of two degrees can now be cubic or higher.</p>

			<p>IGES TRANSLATOR Option added to prepend or not prepend parent filename as root object. When option is set in ASAP Preferences, the change stays in effect in subsequent translations; when set in IGES Setup dialog, change is temporary.</p>

			<p/>

			<p>DISPLAY</p>

			<p>FFT Using the new FTSIZE command described above, the Fourier transform size can be reduced from the default maximum.</p>

			<p>GRID POLAR now has an alternate form that is shorter and simpler.</p>

			<p>$READ The $READ macro, commonly used to read ASAP input from a named file, can now be nested within macros or other $READ files.</p>

			<p>$EVAL A new macro, similar to $ITER, that rapidly evaluates $FCN functions.</p>
	
			<p>$ITER This macro was improved in two areas. In both forms of this command, the maximum number of supported variables was increased from 25 to 40.  Also, the second form of $ITER now allows the merit function to be composed of up to 125 separate user-defined functions, up from 100.</p>

			<p>$FCN ASAP now supports up to 60 function ($FCN) definitions, increased from 20.</p>

			<p>As usual, *.SYS files are incompatible with previous versions. (CAUTION: These binary files should never be used as archives of old systems since their formats often change from version to version.)</p>

			<p>Improvements were made in the way SURFACE-based objects appear in the 3D Viewer. ASAP now performs more intelligent intrinsic patching of surfaces (usually higher).</p>

			<p>ASAP Pro capabilities increased to keep pace with typical 128MB workstations:</p>

			<br/><table border="0"><thead align="left"/><tbody><tr style="background-color:#e8f0fb;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 11px"><td><span/></td><td><span>Increased from:</span></td><td><span>To:</span></td></tr><tr style="background-color:#e8f0fb;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 11px"><td><span>Maximum number of objects</span></td><td><span>3,000</span></td><td><span>9,999</span></td></tr><tr style="background-color:#e8f0fb;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 11px"><td><span>Maximum number of entities</span></td><td><span>20,000</span></td><td><span>30,000</span></td></tr><tr style="background-color:#e8f0fb;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 11px"><td><span>Total geometry storage</span></td><td><span>2,000,000</span></td><td><span><p>3,000,000</p>
<p> FP numbers</p>
</span></td></tr></tbody></table>
			<p>Many “fatal” program termination conditions were eliminated when users exceed prescribed limits.</p>

			<p>Several significant improvements were made to IGES import capabilities:</p>

			<p>Option added to increase the order (that is, the degree) of Bezier curve segments. As a result, the translator can now generate exact versions of cubics (112), bicubics (114), and Beziers (126/128 subset).</p>

			<p>Option added to prepend or not prepend parent filename each time that IGES file is re-imported. When the option is set (checked or unchecked) in ASAP Preferences, change stays in effect; when set in IGES Setup dialog, change is temporary.</p>

			<p>Edge-based objects generated with the SWEEP AXIS 360 command have improved parabasal and/or GRIN ray intersection performance.</p>
