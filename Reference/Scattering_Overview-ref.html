  <div><p>Scattering is generally defined as the removal of energy from an
	 incident wave and the subsequent re-emission of some portion of that energy.
	 The macroscopic laws of refraction and reflection may even be considered
	 special cases of the statistical averages of scattering phenomena. This topic
	 discusses scatter from nonsmooth surfaces; that is, surface scattering, since
	 ASAP is primarily designed to model surface scattering phenomena. Volume
	 scattering can be modeled by using many transparent scattering surfaces to
	 partition the volume.

		<p>Scattered light is more commonly associated with the re-emission of
		  incident energy from small particles, such as atoms or dust in the atmosphere,
		  dust on a surface, or a nonsmooth surface finish, which is referred to as
		  surface scattering.
		</p>
 
		<p>Scatter may also be caused by bulk material contamination or by
		  variations in the homogeneity of the index of refraction of the material, which
		  is referred to as volume scattering. 
		</p>

		<p>Most optical software packages model surfaces as perfectly smooth,
		  even though in reality they are not. The optical grinding and polishing
		  processes damage the surface and subsurface of the optic. 
		</p>
 
		<p>Painted surfaces, such as those used for baffles or lens mounts,
		  generally have rougher base surfaces than optical surfaces, since the paint is
		  usually applied to a metal substrate. 
		</p>
 
		<p>In either case, it is the scattered energy from these surfaces that
		  propagates to undesired places in the optical system thereby reducing system
		  performance. You must, therefore, be able to quantify the scatter from these
		  surfaces.

		<p>A common mechanical way to describe the roughness of a surface is by
		  its RMS surface roughness. The RMS surface roughness may be related to the
		  scattering properties of the surface; namely, the BSDF function. The BSDF is
		  generally defined as the ratio of the scattered surface radiance to the
		  incident surface irradiance. The BSDF is what ASAP requires to simulate surface
		  scattering. Mathematically, this is a six-dimensional quantity describing how
		  light scatters off a surface as a function of angle and position on the
		  surface.
		</p>
 
		<p>The surface roughness is measurable directly via profile methods.

			 transmissive optics cannot be measured via profile methods. The RMS surface
			 roughness is a compact and convenient figure of merit for surface scattering,
			 but presents severe restrictions on its use. For example, after examining the

			 you may notice they are for optically polished surfaces.

			 general, surfaces with much higher surface roughnesses have scattering
			 properties that behave radically different from optically polished surfaces. In

		<p>The BSDF is a special form of what is called ARS. ARS is a product of
		  the intrinsic surface roughness and the extrinsic measurement parameters of
		  incident wavelength, angle of incidence, material index, polarization state,
		  and scattering angle. The integral of ARS over all angles is the TIS. TIS is
		  the ratio of light scattered into a hemisphere to the total incident specular
		  light. It is related to the RMS surface roughness by the following equation:
		</p>
 
		<p><a name="Scattering_Overview__image_621133DE752E48CFB3D0792807499324"><!-- --></a><img id="Scattering_Overview__image_621133DE752E48CFB3D0792807499324" src="../Equations/Scattering_Overview_equation1.gif" width="440" height="195"/>
		</p>
 
		<p>This equation is valid between wavelengths of 0.1 to 1.15Î¼m and only
		  if the heights of surface irregularities are small compared to the incident
		  wavelength (approximately 100 Angstroms, if HeNe light is used). This theory
		  also assumes that the scattering originates solely at the top surface and is
		  not attributable to material inhomogeneity or multilayer coatings.
		</p>
 
		<p>ARS measurements relate the angular distribution of scattered light to
		  the surface roughness of the optic. It is related mathematically to the TIS as:
		</p>

		</p>
 
		<p>A special form of ARS (and the one most commonly used in ASAP) is the
		  BSDF. The BSDF has dimensions of inverse solid angle and is defined as follows:

		<p>Although there is no consistent convention for plotting BSDF, it is
		  commonly expressed and plotted in the following format (after Harvey).
		</p>
 
		<a name="Scattering_Overview__image_589AF3203DC84DFE941763EACF250513"><!-- --></a><img id="Scattering_Overview__image_589AF3203DC84DFE941763EACF250513" src="../Equations/Scattering_Overview_equation6.gif" width="296" height="255"/> 
		<p>By plotting the BSDF this way, the shift invariance of the BSDF is
		  demonstrated for optically polished surfaces. This is not the case for painted
		  surfaces. For smooth surfaces, m is typically between -1 and -3. The BSDF is
		  typically between 0.01 and 0.07 in the visible for 0- degree- to 20-degree
		  angles of incidence.
		</p>
 
		<p>The BSDF may be related to RMS surface roughness with the following
		  equation:
		</p>

		</p>
 
		<p>This equation was derived assuming that the RMS surface roughness is
		  much less than one wave and that most of the scatter occurs between the angles
		  arcsin(Î²1) and arcsin(Î²2). 
		</p>
 
		<p>Often, BSDF measurements for smooth surfaces are made at a wavelength
		  other than the operating wavelength. The BSDF at a second wavelength may be
		  calculated from the following relation:
		</p>
 
		<p><a name="Scattering_Overview__image"><!-- --></a><img id="Scattering_Overview__image" src="../Equations/Scattering_Overview_equation10.gif" width="271" height="68"/>
		</p>
 
		<p>This equation is valid in the wavelength range of 0.4 to 0.6Âµm. A
		  similar scaling law does not exist for paints.
