			<p>This manual describes a general raytracing computer program. The program has been designed to accurately model complex opto-mechanical systems. Similar to the GUERAP straylight analysis programs, it utilizes a very powerful geometrical approach that permits a nearly limitless variety of systems to be handled in a straightforward manner. As opposed to most other raytracing algorithms, all surfaces and ray data are referenced to a single global Cartesian coordinate system. Object surfaces are represented by a general 35-term polynomial (taken to fourth-order in the three Cartesian components) and can be bounded by other surfaces of the same general form. Therefore, anything from a simple plane with a polygonal boundary to an arbitrarily oriented elliptical toroid can be modeled precisely.</p>

			<p>Bundles of rays can be traced through the system such that after every reflection or refraction each ray always transfers to the nearest object. Also, rays are allowed to interact with an object any number of times, i.e. multiple bounces. Therefore, the program easily handles the "funneling" effect of non-imaging radiation collectors as well as imaging systems. In addition, each ray may be assigned an arbitrary total flux that is reduced by volume and surface absorption (or increased in a gain medium) as the ray propagates through the system. The standard Fresnel equations are used to not only calculate (as a function of incidence angle) transmission losses at interfaces between two dielectric media, but also reflection losses at any dielectric/conductor interfaces.</p>
